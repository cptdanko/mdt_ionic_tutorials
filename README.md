# MDT Ionic Tutorials
[![N|Solid](https://mydaytodo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MDTicon-1-150x150.png)](https://mydaytodo.com/)

The aim of this repo is to "house" all the code that I use to explain certain concepts in building Hybrid apps using Ionic Framework. 
# Current state
At this point, it contains the sample code to,

    - Build an Ionic app using Firebase
    - Use Firebase for email based authentication
    - Save and Retrieve notes in a Firebase/Firestore using user credentials
    - REMEMBER! You need to add the environments file for this to work
    - Build a reusable Angular component to upload an image(file) to Firebase storage

If you would like to know more about this, then have a read of the following blogposts, 
- [How to save user data with Firebase and Ionic]
- [Reusable Angular/Ionic (4) component to upload images to Firebase storage]

> Please keep in mind, the purpose of the code here is to demonstrate a conept of how to do certain things in a NoSql database. This is by no means the most effcient way of doing things.

# Reason
I created this repo while working on my first cross platform app, [Simple Notes] for Android. To this point, I have only released that app on Android but a native iOS version of it is already in the works. You can read some of my other reasons to do this in my [blogpost]

# While you are here
Maybe checkout some of the other [apps] that I have built at [My Day To-Do]
